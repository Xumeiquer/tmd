## About The Project

![Screen Shot](rsc/img/screenshot.png)

Telegram Media Downloader is a lightweight Telegram client and its only feature is download media files from chats, channels, forums, etc.

## Built With

This project is build using [zelenin](https://github.com/zelenin/go-tdlib) which is a [Go](https://go.dev) wrapper for the [Telegram Database Library](https://github.com/tdlib/td).

## Getting Started

Telegram Media Downloader is a command line application that runs inside a Docker container. The main reason is to ease the build process as well as the distribution of it.

### Prerequisites

You will need to [register an application](https://my.telegram.org/apps) in Telegram to obtain an `API_ID` and `API_HASH`, Telegram Media Downloader will need the API information to connect to Telegram on your behalf.
On the other hand, you need to have Docker installed to be able to execute Telegram Media Downloader.

You also need Docker to be installed on your system. Please go to [Docker install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to see how Docker can be installed on your system.

### Installation

There is no installation as such. TMD is build on top of Docker so the unique thing required to do is pulling the TMD image.
